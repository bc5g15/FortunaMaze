# FortunaMaze
My submission for the Computer Systems 2 Task 7 Application

## Introduction
The goal of this game is to navigate through as many randomly generated mazes as you can,
while gathering as much treasure as possible.

## Features

* Each maze is pseudorandomly generated. You will get the same sequence of mazes each time you play
* Two difficulty modes - Easy and Hard
...* In hard mode the first, and every subsequent sixth maze will be generated by a recursive-backtraking algorithm
...* In easy mode every maze will be a binary tree maze
